Network Interface Monitoring Tool I wrote for fun. I am not an expert at C so apologies for bad code. Feel free to suggest changes.

Requirements:

- Linux only
- Need ncurses library installed: `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

To compile: gcc -Iheaders/ main.c -lncurses -o main
